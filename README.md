# :cityscape: LoD3 Road Space Models

This [CityGML](https://www.ogc.org/standards/citygml) dataset contains road space models (over 50 building models) in the area of [Ingolstadt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingolstadt).
To ensure the highest accuracy geometrically as well as semantically, the dataset was manually modeled based on the mobile laser scannings (MLS) provided by the company [3D Mapping Solutions GmbH](https://www.3d-mapping.de/en/) (relative accuracy in the range of 1-3cm).
Moreover, a complementary [OpenDRIVE](https://www.asam.net/standards/detail/opendrive/) dataset is available, which includes the road network, traffic lights, fences, vegetation and so on:

## :triangular_flag_on_post: What is modeled in LoD3?

There are several approaches to model Building in CityGML 2.0 (e.g. see [Biljecki et al.](http://pure.tudelft.nl/ws/portalfiles/portal/4377508/Biljecki2016to.pdf)). In our case, due to the acquistion geometry of MLS point clouds, the Building object consists of very detailed representation of facades elements but on the other hand it might lack roof elements and entities located in the Building's backyard. Thus, we encourage to see the list below for detailed description of the Building in our Ingolstadt LoD3 dataset:

* :house: Building consists of:
  * Ground Surfaces
  * Roof Surfaces
  * Wall Surfaces
  * Outer Ceiling Surfaces
  * Outer Floor Surfaces
  * Closure Surfaces
  * Windows modeled in detail
  * Doors modeled in detail
  * Building Installations
    * Balconies
    * Passages
    * Arcades
    * Loggias
    * Stairs and Porches
    * (Some) Dormers
  * Textures (approximated based on visual inspection)

* :house: Building does **NOT** consists of:
  * Overhanging Building Elements
  * Roof structure details
  * Objects located in the Building's backyard (not facing the street)
  * Building Installations
    * Chimneys
    * Rain Gutters
    * (Some) Dormers
    * Real (e.g. ortophoto) textures

The terminology according to [SIG3D](https://en.wiki.quality.sig3d.org/index.php?title=Modeling_Guide_for_3D_Objects_-_Part_2:_Modeling_of_Buildings_(LoD1,_LoD2,_LoD3)).
